                    <strong>Problem Statement 1: Smarter Surveillance System</strong>
                    <div class="problem-description">
                    <p><strong>PS (Prelims):</strong> At present, a lot of man hours are spent on physical patrolling of
                        border areas and compounds. Fencing wires are not reliable and easy to breach, in large areas it
                        is difficult to be available at all locations, and if someone is breaching in absence of guard,
                        guard will know only when they reach the breach site. Also, it takes a lot of time to cover the
                        compound walls if the area is large.</p>
                    <p><strong>PS (Mains) Extension:</strong> [Add the extension description for the main round here, if
                        applicable]</p>

                        automatic Challan for violation. Must develop 04 such pillars for problem extension in the main
                        round.</p>
                    <p>PS (Mains) Extension: Vehicle honk system where Sensors/Smart Pillars will interact with each
                        other, and vehicles will be told about approaching vehicles from the other blind fold end or
                        U-turn in hills. For instance- in a hilly area with a blind curve, both directions vehicle can’t
                        see or gauge whether another vehicle coming in their direction with speed, such sensors based
                        upon speed instantly generate an alert/honking system to alert both drivers</p>
                    <p>Expectation: Road Safety is a big concern for police and such smart sensors/smart pillars will
                        help to reduce accidents. Will be a useful installation where such sensors will alert in both
                        directions regarding the movement of vehicles along with measurement of Speed.</p>

                    <p>PS (Prelims): Tool which can horizontally crawl and gather data across different platforms. This

                    <p>Expectation: Police will be able to crowd source the information from different platforms and
                        instantly develop the profile of the suspected person. E.g., based upon different types of
                        classification.</p>

                    <p>PS (Mains) Extension: The tool/apps should be robust and platform independent to be easily
                        deployed through a smartphone. It must categorically ease the work of police and give some
                        productive result based upon the coding capability of the team. This problem is open-ended, and

                        applicability/relevancy for police. Thus, we give an opportunity to students to code if they
